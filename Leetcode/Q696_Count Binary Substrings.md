给一个字符串，计算0和1次数相同且各连续的子串的个数。

#### Example 1

```
Input: "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.

```

#### Example 2

```
Input: "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.

```
